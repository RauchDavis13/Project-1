# Project 1 - The Joke-Inator
​
## Bootcamp: Project 1
​
The purpose of this assignment, is to create a working website in a team format, using at least 2 API's, in addition to the project acceptance criteria.
​
- Motivation: Test what has been learned through practical application and testing of JQuery,  Javascript, CSS, HTML 3rd party styling and usage of client side API's related to the construct of this assignment
​
- Project: Take the lessons learned from languages learned to date (HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery), as well as utilize at least 2 API' and a 3rd styling library.  Implement best practices for scout rule, coding, GitHub repository building, README.md construction.
​
- Problem Solved: Successful website is built to feature a team decided theme around the acceptance criteria
​
- Lessons Learned: Many.  Working as a team reinforced the idea of, the power of the many produces a better product.  Our team shared ideas, experimented with different team decided ideas and contributed to the overall end result utilizing our individual strengths.  By dividing responsibilities, we were able to accomplish more quicker.  Working as a team through GitHub still needs more experience to hone how to merge, compare code, workflow and pulling data.  While we made it work, our use of GitHub needs to flow with the idea of different contributors to a project...better.

## Acceptance Criteria
​
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input):  User can enter a name, and also save their favorite jokes.  The save jokes are then button click selectable to randomly show any saved joke in the text area.  Upon refresh, user's name is 
​
- Use at least two server-side APIs:  Our site connects to multiple API's, linking 6 different data sets of information.  
​
Chuck Norris Joke API = "https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random"
Dad Jokes API = "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/"
Dark Jokes API = "https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Dark?type=single"
Programming Jokes API = "https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming?type=single"
Random Jokes API = "https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Miscellaneous?type=single"
​
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data: The user has the option of both, saving a user name, as well as storing favorite jokes that are displayed in the Joke-Inator text box.  Upon refreshing the page, both of the values are returned to the page. 
​
- Be responsive: The site is mobile friendly, through desktop monitor friendly.  Bootstrap is used extensively, along with flex.
​
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.): Id's and classnames were used extensively to style and connect to Javascript functioning.  Commenting is descriptive and abundant. 
​
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application):  README follows best practice protocols.
